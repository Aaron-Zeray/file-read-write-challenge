# File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è

## Overview

This Python project demonstrates **file handling and error management**.  
It reads the content of a user-specified file, modifies it (converts to uppercase), and writes the modified content to a new file.

The project also implements **error handling**, ensuring the program gracefully manages issues like missing files or read/write errors.

---

## Features

- Prompt user for a filename to read.
- Read file contents safely.
- Modify the content (example: convert to uppercase).
- Write the modified content to a new file prefixed with `modified_`.
- Handle errors such as:
  - File not found
  - Input/output errors

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).
- A sample text file to test the program.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-read-write-challenge.git
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd file-read-write-challenge
Usage
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python file_read_write.py
Enter the filename you want to read when prompted.

The program will create a new file called modified_<filename> with the modified content.

If the file doesn‚Äôt exist, an error message will be displayed.
